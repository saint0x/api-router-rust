  connection-pooling:
    date: '2024-11-20'
    feature: Connection pooling for database connections
    test_approach: Compared pooled vs non-pooled connections across 3 endpoints (ping, data fetch, complex process)
    technical_outcome: |
      - Total RPS decreased by 4.9%
      - Average latency increased by 15.9%
      - Most significant impact on complex processing endpoint
    impact: Not implemented - performance degradation observed with connection pooling
    implemented: false
  request-batching:
    date: '2024-11-20'
    feature: Request batching for complex processing
    test_approach: Compared current vs new implementation across 3 endpoints
    technical_outcome: |
      - Total RPS decreased by 19.8%
      - Average latency increased by 4133.8%
      - Severe performance degradation in request processing
    impact: Not implemented - significant performance degradation with request batching
    implemented: false
