## Component Responsibilities

### HTTP Handler
- Manages HTTP connections
- Handles connection pooling
- Implements retry logic
- Manages timeouts

### WebSocket Support
- Real-time communication
- Stream management
- Connection maintenance
- Event handling

### Metrics Collection
- Performance tracking
- Latency monitoring
- Error rate tracking
- Usage statistics

### Optimization
- Response caching
- Data compression
- Connection reuse
- Request coalescing

## Key Features

1. Performance
   - Connection pooling
   - Keep-alive management
   - Efficient retry handling
   - Smart caching

2. Reliability
   - Automatic retries
   - Circuit breaking
   - Timeout handling
   - Error recovery

3. Monitoring
   - Performance metrics
   - Error tracking
   - Usage statistics
   - Health monitoring

## Integration Points

- Connects with core router
- Interfaces with adapters
- Reports to metrics system
- Manages network resources

This layer ensures efficient and reliable network communication while maintaining performance metrics.
